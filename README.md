# PIV processing
Detect particle sizes using PIV image.

MATLAB code that accepts a BMP image, processes it, and returns a table of particles and associated data.
The code should generally perform the following processes:

 1. Image filtered, noise removed
 2. Edges detected
 3. Polygons filled
 4. Particles detected
 5. Particle data calculated
 6. Particle data processed
 7. Particle data output (plot, text etc.)
